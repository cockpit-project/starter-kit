# This is a script run to release this project through Cockpituous:
# https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpituous/tree/main/release

# Anything that start with 'job' may run in a way that it SIGSTOP's
# itself when preliminary preparition and then gets a SIGCONT in
# order to complete its work.
#
# Check cockpituous documentation for available release targets.
#
# This gets run through a GitHub action: enable and adjust
# .github/workflows/release.yml.disabled once you are ready.

# Once you have a Fedora package, can upload to Fedora automatically: Provide the
# secrets in .github/workflows/release.yml on GitHub, and enable the following:

## Authenticate for pushing into Fedora dist-git
# cat ~/.fedora-password | kinit yourfedorauser@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG
## Do fedora builds for the tag, using tarball
# job release-koji -k main
# job release-koji f33
# job release-bodhi F33

# These are likely the first of your release targets; but run them after Fedora uploads,
# so that failures there will fail the release early, before publishing on GitHub

# this needs no explicit secrets, just the GitHub action provided default one
# job release-github

# This needs secrets.COPR_TOKEN in .github/workflows/release.yml
# job release-copr @myorg/myrepo
